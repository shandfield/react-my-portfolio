      <p style={{textAlign: "center",fontWeight: "bold", width: "75%", margin: "auto", paddingTop: "1em"}}> I was born and raised in Southern California. With my love for animals, I applied for and was accepted to Colorado State University, the #2 rated Veterinarian school in the country. My strong academics allowed me to attend all four years of college, at Colorado State University, on a Presidential Scholarship. I quickly decided that four years of Chemistry exceeded my brain power and decided on a new course of study. In 2013, I graduated from CSU with a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Natural Science and never looked back. I have made my home in Colorado and love the great outdoors.</p>
      <p style={{textAlign: "center", fontWeight: "bold", width: "75%", margin: "auto", paddingTop: "1em"}}> After college, I began working in private probation, moved to being a licensed Colorado Certified Social Worker, in Child Protective Services, and now have chosen a career in the Information Technology field.</p>
      <p style={{textAlign: "center", fontWeight: "bold", width: "75%", margin: "auto", paddingTop: "1em"}}> Some of my favorite hobbies and activities are snowboarding, hiking, wakeboarding, yoga, meditation, and spending time with friends and family. I played competitive soccer through high school and learned the importance of teamwork. Through competitive sports, I also learned how to be a leader and the value of hard work. I have carried those values with me and work each day to excel in my personal and professional life. </p>
      <p style={{textAlign: "center", fontWeight: "bold", width: "75%", margin: "auto", paddingTop: "1em"}}> Currently, I am a Full Stack Web Developer with many newly obtained skills from the University of Denver's Coding Boot Camp. I obtained my certification in September of 2020 and plan to better my knowledge and abilities every day.
