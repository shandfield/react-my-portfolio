      <div><h1>About Page</h1>
      <p> I am originally from Orange, California and moved to Colorado in 2009. From 2009 to 2013, I attended Colorado State University and graduated in four years. I obtained a Bachelors in Psychology and a Minor in Criminology/ Criminal Justice. From 2014 to 2018, my profession as a private case-manager began in Loveland, CO and ended in Centennial/Castle Rock, CO. My accomplishments during that time include starting as entry level Case Manager, and working hard to becoming a District Manager in 2017. By the end of my career in Private Probation, I was in charge of two offices and multiple staff. In August of 2018, I made the transition to Child Support. I remained there from August of 2018 to July 2019. In July 2019, I became a Colorado Certified Social Worker, that focused on Child Protection in the Intake unit. </p>
      <p> Currently, I am a Full Stack Web Developer with many newly obtained skills from the University of Denver's Coding Boot Camp. I obtained my certification in September of 2020.</p>
