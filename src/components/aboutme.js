      <p style={{textAlign: "center",fontWeight: "bold", width: "75%", margin: "auto", paddingTop: "1em"}}> I am originally from Orange, California and moved to Colorado in 2009. From 2009 to 2013, I attended Colorado State University. I obtained a Bachelors in Psychology and a Minor in Criminology/ Criminal Justice. From 2014 to 2018, my profession as a private Case-Manager began in Loveland, CO and ended in Centennial/Castle Rock, CO. My accomplishments during that time include starting as entry level Case Manager, and working hard to becoming a District Manager in 2017. By the end of my career in Private Probation, I was in charge of two offices and multiple staff. In August of 2018, I made the transition to Child Support. I remained there from August of 2018 to July 2019. In July 2019, I became a Colorado Certified Social Worker, that focused on Child Protection in the Intake unit. </p>
      <p style={{textAlign: "center", fontWeight: "bold", width: "75%", margin: "auto", paddingTop: "1em"}}> Some of my favorite hobbies and activities are snowboarding, hiking, waterboarding, yoga, meditation, and spending time with friends and family. I also love to learn new things in many different fields and look to better myself each day.</p>
      <p style={{textAlign: "center", fontWeight: "bold", width: "75%", margin: "auto", paddingTop: "1em"}}> Currently, I am a Full Stack Web Developer with many newly obtained skills from the University of Denver's Coding Boot Camp. I obtained my certification in September of 2020.</p>
