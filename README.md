My-React-Porfolio

![React-Portfolio Demo](https://i.imgur.com/wiuCJqi.gif)
Description: A living portfolio made with React. It is a better model then the first one I created with HTML and CSS only. It is a living project, as I am continuing to work and improve it. I plan to continue to work on the cards in the project section and look at each assignment I have completed and break them down into their proper sections.
