## General info
This porfolio keeps a record of my resume, projects, and contact information for employment. It is broken down into sections and everything is very neat and organized into different sections on my projects page espicially. I have created sub-categories for React, MEAN/MERN, Express, JSON, MySQL, and Node and group projects. In addition, there is a about me section, a contact page with my telephone number, email, Github and LinkedIn information, and a resume section.
